# 1. Given two points p1 and p2, calculate
#   the distance between them.

p1 = (3,5)
p2 = (6,17)

x1, y1 = p1[0], p1[1]
x2, y2 = p2[0], p2[1]

distance = ((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)**0.5
print('Th distance = ' ,distance)

#2. Using the formula for a line
#   calculate th value of y if
#   the slope = 1.33, b =2, and
#   the value of x = 7
x= 9
b= 2
m= 1.33

y = (m* x)+b
print('y is equal to ',y=13.97)
